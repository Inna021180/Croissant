      <p>
            A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
        shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
        laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent
        shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
        in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
        a puff pastry. <br />
        <br />

        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
        crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Kipferls have long been
        a staple of Austrian cuisine, and are often found in French bakeries and
        pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th
        century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl
        with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the
        development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made
        them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor.
        The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
        response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the
        croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
        frozen dough.
